      "p1": "Hi, I'm Ying-Hsien Lee. I'm a frontend engineer and designer passionate about creating beautiful things in the digital world. For me, code is not just a pile of logic, but a brush to realize creativity and solve problems. I enjoy transforming an abstract idea into a tangible product through meticulous design and rigorous engineering.",
      "p2": "My journey began with a love for visual arts, but soon I found that static images couldn't satisfy my craving for interaction. This led me into the world of web development. Here, I found the perfect intersection of technology and humanities: I can inject life into interfaces with JavaScript, depict delicate emotions with CSS, and build solid and inclusive structures with semantic HTML. I firmly believe that the best products are those that achieve a delicate balance between functionality, aesthetics, and usability.",
      "p3": "On this blog, I document my learning, thoughts, and practices. It's both my personal knowledge base and my window to dialogue with the world. Whether you're a potential collaborator, a peer, or just a curious reader about the digital world, I welcome you to stay, explore, and exchange ideas."

    "skills": {
      "title": "My Skill Spectrum",
      "p1": "I dislike defining skills with lengthy lists because technology is fluid, and real ability lies in integration and application. My core expertise revolves around 'creating high-quality Web frontend experiences.' This means I can skillfully use vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3, and HTML5 to construct complex interactive interfaces, with a strong emphasis on code maintainability and performance. I'm accustomed to pixel-perfect implementation of designs, adding just the right amount of dynamism through CSS animations and SVG.",
      "p2": "On the design side, I'm familiar with the complete process from user research and wireframing to high-fidelity prototype design. I excel at establishing design systems to ensure brand visual consistency across different platforms. At the same time, I have a near-obsessive pursuit of accessibility design (A11Y) and Web performance optimization, because I believe digital products should serve everyone and respect their time."
